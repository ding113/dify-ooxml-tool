## [0.0.4] - 2025-08-27

### üéâ Major Features Added
- **Chunked Translation Support**: Added support for chunked translation workflows using iteration nodes
  - `get_translation_texts` now supports `output_format` parameter with "string" and "array" options
  - Array output creates optimally sized chunks (~1500 characters or 50 XML segments each)
  - `update_translations` now handles both single string and array chunk inputs
  - Full backward compatibility with existing single-string workflows

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Parameter Processing**: Advanced dynamic type detection for iteration node parameters
  - Automatic detection and parsing of serialized arrays from iteration nodes
  - Support for both real arrays and string-serialized arrays: `"['chunk1', 'chunk2']"`
  - Robust error handling with fallback to string processing
- **Storage Format Consistency**: Fixed critical storage format mismatch between tools
  - `update_translations` now preserves original storage format (batched/compressed/simple)
  - Maintains compatibility with extract tool's batched+compressed storage
  - Ensures proper data flow from extract ‚Üí get_texts ‚Üí update ‚Üí rebuild
- **Performance Optimizations**: Enhanced JSON processing with orjson integration
  - High-performance serialization/deserialization
  - Optimized chunk combination and processing
  - Improved logging for better debugging

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed "No translations found" error in rebuild step after successful updates
- Resolved parameter serialization issues with iteration node arrays
- Fixed storage key inconsistencies between workflow steps
- Improved error handling for malformed translation inputs

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive chunked translation workflow documentation
- Updated tool descriptions with array parameter support
